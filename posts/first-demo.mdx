Welcome to the **Tufte-styled blog**!

Here is Euler's famous identity with inline math:
<span className="marginnote">$$ e^{i\pi} + 1 = 0 $$ <br/> is a beautiful relation between three constants that evolved independently in mathematics.</span>

### Code Example

```js
function greet() {
  console.log("Hello from Tufte!");
}
greet();
```

### Math Block

$$
\int_0^1 x^2 \, dx = \frac{1}{3}
$$

That's all for now!
